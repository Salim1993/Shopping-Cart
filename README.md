# Shopping Cart

This is the shopping cart project from the Odin Project. 

This is based of Streamers from followed list on my twitch account. It will sort them by concurrent viewers at the time while they are online. <br>
The cost will be the amount of viewers divided by a 100. You can click to add streamers to your cart. Then you can go to checkout to see items in your cart. 

Below is the default react commands to get the project up and running.
